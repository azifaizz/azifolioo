        <h2>MACHINE LEARNING BASED PREDICTING REMAINING USEFUL LIFE(RUL) FOR EV BATTERIES</h2>
        <p><strong>Work Status:</strong><strong> WORK ON PROGRESS⚠️</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
            The increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) has necessitated advancements in battery health monitoring and predictive maintenance strategies. Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of EV batteries is crucial for optimizing performance, ensuring safety, and reducing operational costs. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting the RUL of EV batteries using a data-driven methodology. A comprehensive dataset incorporating key battery parameters such as charge/discharge cycles, state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), temperature, internal resistance, and energy efficiency is utilized for training predictive models. Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, and deep learning models like LSTM and CNN, are evaluated to determine the most accurate model for RUL estimation. The models are trained and tested on real-world and synthetic battery degradation datasets, and their performance is assessed using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R² score. The results indicate that deep learning models, particularly LSTM, demonstrate superior predictive accuracy in capturing the nonlinear degradation patterns of EV batteries. This study provides a robust and scalable approach for battery life prediction, aiding in efficient battery management, proactive maintenance scheduling, and enhanced battery longevity, ultimately contributing to the sustainability of electric mobility.</p>

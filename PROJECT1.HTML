        <h2>CNN Based Brain Tumor cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning</h2>
        <p><strong>Place of Work:</strong> Scott Christian College,Nagercoil</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
            Brain tumor prediction is a critical task in medical diagnostics, requiring accurate and efficient methods to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning algorithms, have demonstrated exceptional performance in image classification and segmentation tasks, making them highly suitable for analyzing complex medical imaging data such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This study proposes a CNN-based machine learning framework for automated brain tumor prediction, leveraging the power of deep feature extraction and hierarchical learning. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of brain images, preprocessed to enhance quality and consistency, and augmented to mitigate overfitting. By employing advanced CNN architectures, such as ResNet, Inception, or custom-designed networks, the system effectively identifies tumor regions and distinguishes between benign and malignant cases with high accuracy. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are used to evaluate the model's efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-based approach outperforms traditional machine learning techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor classification. This research underscores the potential of CNNs in revolutionizing medical diagnostics by providing a reliable, scalable, and automated solution for early brain tumor detection, ultimately aiding in timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Future work includes integrating explainable AI techniques to enhance model interpretability and deploying the system in clinical settings for real-world validation.</p>
